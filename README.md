- Hi, I’m @chrisc-2601

- I’m interested in using the github space to showcase the work i have done in the Cyber Security & Digital Forensics space- primarily built during my studies.

- Im currently learning as many of the wide-ranging nuances of cybersec as I can- but there is not enough time in the day! I am also in the final year of my Bsc Cyber Security & Forensics, minroing in Asian Studies, degree.

- Hopefully you can access my content and use it yourself in your own cybersec journey. Please feel free to comment and provide feedback and guidance.
